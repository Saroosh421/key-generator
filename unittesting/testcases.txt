Test cases are an essential part of the software development life cycle.
They are used to verify the functionality of software and ensure that it meets the requirements and specifications.
A test case consists of a set of steps that are executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of the software.
Test cases can be automated or manual, and they are designed to identify defects or bugs in the software.
Test cases can be categorized into different types based on their purpose, such as functional, non-functional, regression, performance, and security testing.
Functional testing is used to verify the functionality of the software, while non-functional testing is used to test aspects such as usability, reliability, and compatibility.
Regression testing is performed to ensure that changes to the software have not introduced new defects or bugs, while performance testing is used to test the performance of the software under different conditions.
In conclusion, test cases are an integral part of software development, and they play a crucial role in ensuring that software is of high quality and meets the requirements and expectations of end-users.
